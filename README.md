# Shi Kong Xing Shou (時空星獸)
This is a disassembly of Shi Kong Xing Shou, an obscure Pokémon/Digimon-esque game developed by Vast Fame.
It uses the sound engine from Mega Man V and assets from Pokémon, Telefang and likely many more games; although there is a lot of original and interesting content here too.

It builds the following ROM:
- **shi_kong_xing_shou.gbc** `MD5: 24e73734490ad40f9d8228a80ff15c0b`

The following baserom with matching MD5 is required, rename to `baserom.gbc`:
- **Shi Kong Xing Shou (Unlicensed, Chinese) (Multicart Rip) [Header Fix].gbc**
